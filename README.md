Pre thoughts
---------------------
The concept of binary trees intrigues me, and I know I will have to grasp
this concept fully if i want to progress. This is also another chance to work
with recursion, so hopefully I can improve in that aspect.

Post thoughts
---------------------
This was really good practice for recursion.
The concepts make sense to me, but I wont really know until I am forced to use
one of these algorithms for an actual program.
